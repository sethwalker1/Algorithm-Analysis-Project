# Scheduling Algorithms Simulation Project
## Overview
This project aims to simulate and evaluate different scheduling algorithms, such as Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and Earliest Deadline First. It's designed to generate metrics for each algorithm to facilitate a comparative analysis.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher

### Installation
This project has no dependencies, so there's no installation. Simply clone the repository!

### Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, execute the main.py script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Project Structure
- main.py: The entry point for the simulation.
- algorithm.py: Contains the implementation of the scheduling algorithms.
- metrics: Folder containing the collected metrics CSV files.

### Usage
The simulation will generate metrics for each scheduling algorithm and save them in a CSV file. You can analyze this data to evaluate the efficiency and performance of each algorithm.
